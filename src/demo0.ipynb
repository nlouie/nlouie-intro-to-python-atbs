    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language (with syntax rules for writing what is considered valid Python code) and the Python interpreter software that reads source code (written in the Python language) and performs its instructions. You can download the Python interpreter for free at https://python.org/, and there are versions for Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name Python comes from the surreal British comedy group Monty Python, not from the snake. Python programmers are affectionately called Pythonistas, and both Monty Python and serpentine references usually pepper Python tutorials and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to type into the interactive shell, also called the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which lets you run (or execute) Python instructions one at a time and instantly shows you the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the interactive shell is great for learning what basic Python instructions do, so give it a try as you follow along. You’ll remember the things you do much better than the things you only read.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Getting started with IDLE\n",
    "Open IDLE (should be installed with Python). An interactive shell will come up. Create a new file, and name it `test.py` You can use this python file to write python programs. Run it from the menu bar, or pressing `F5`\n",
    "\n",
    "[IDLE Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the interactive shell is good for running Python instructions one at a time, to write entire Python programs, you’ll type the instructions into the file editor. The file editor is similar to text editors such as Notepad or TextMate, but it has some features specifically for entering source code.\n",
    "- The interactive shell window will always be the one with the `>>>` prompt.\n",
    "- The file editor window will not have the `>>>` prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python on the Command Line (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to learn Python the hard way, using the command line is best way to learn.\n",
    "- The command line/terminal/shell accepts text commands, and will output some result\n",
    "- For Windows this is `Powershell.exe`, for MacOS, this is `Terminal.app`, for Linux, this is `/bin/bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "Download a text editor, like [Atom](https://atom.io)\n",

    "You can compute expressions with a calculator or enter string concatenations with a word processor. You can even do string replication easily by copying and pasting text. But expressions, and their component values—operators, variables, and function calls—are the basic building blocks that make programs. Once you know how to handle these elements, you will be able to instruct Python to operate on large amounts of data for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to remember the different types of operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, and ** for math operations, and + and * for string operations) and the three data types (integers, floating-point numbers, and strings) introduced in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I introduced a few different functions as well. The print() and input() functions handle simple text output (to the screen) and input (from the keyboard). The len() function takes a string and evaluates to an int of the number of characters in the string. The str(), int(), and float() functions will evaluate to the string, integer, or floating-point number form of the value they are passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to tell Python to make intelligent decisions about what code to run, what code to skip, and what code to repeat based on the values it has. This is known as flow control, and it allows you to write programs that make intelligent decisions."
